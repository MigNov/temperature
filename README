 Temperature Monitor
 ====================

This application monitors the CPU/motherboard temperature by reading
values from CPU-specific register (MSR registers) and/or registers
of PCI devices being defined in the XML configuration file.

The whole application is written in C language with requirements for
libxml2 and optionally pciutils-devel to support PCI device access.

Terminology
-----------

This app should be referred to as "Temperature Monitor" but for the
package containing this app the abbreviated form "temp-monitor" is
acceptible.
